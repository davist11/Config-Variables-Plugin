h1. Config Variables Plugin

I wanted to have access to things like the base_path on my server without having to use PHP. So this plugin gives access to anything that is in the $config array.

h2. Requirements & Installation

Config Variables is built to run on EE 2.0. To install:

* Copy the config folder into your /system/expressionengine/third_party/ directory.

h2. Usage

<pre>{exp:config:vars value="base_path"}</pre>

To see all of the possible values, just pass in "all"

<pre>{exp:config:vars value="all"}</pre>
